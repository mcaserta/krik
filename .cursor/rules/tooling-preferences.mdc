# Tooling Preferences

- Prettier usage: Use the system Prettier on PATH for formatting. Do not invoke Prettier via npx.
  - Example: `prettier --write "**/*.md"`

- Shell command output: Do not pipe commands through `cat`. Run commands directly unless explicitly needed to avoid a pager.

These preferences apply to development tasks and release workflow steps that involve formatting or shell commands.
