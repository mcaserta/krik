### Workspace Memories

- Theme switching: Prefer using the CLI flag `--theme` (or `-t`) to select a
  theme instead of editing `content/site.toml`.
- Git actions: Do not run `git add`/`git commit` automatically unless explicitly
  instructed.
- Site description: Avoid repeating the site title in the site description.
- Use `cargo run --` to run krik instead of relying on `kk` on the system PATH
- In order to use prittier on `.cursor/**/*.mdc` files, you need to pass the
  `--parser markdown` option so the files are propertly recognized as markdown
  files
