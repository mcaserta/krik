# Contact

This page demonstrates that files in the root of the content directory
automatically use the `page` template.

## Get in Touch

This is an example contact page showing how root-level content is handled by
Krik.

### Template Detection

Since this file is located at `content/contact.md` (not in a `posts/` or
`pages/` subdirectory), it automatically uses the `page` template, giving it:

- Clean, focused layout
- Language selector (if translations exist)
- Scroll-to-top button
- Consistent styling with other pages

### Organization Flexibility

You can organize your content flexibly:

- **Posts**: `content/posts/` for blog entries
- **Pages**: `content/pages/` for static pages
- **Root Content**: Direct in `content/` for top-level pages like this one

All content types support:

- Full markdown formatting
- Front matter metadata
- Internationalization
- Custom templates (via `layout` field)
